# Weekly Executive Brief — Week Ending 2026-02-06

## Portfolio Snapshot
- Total initiatives: **6**
- Confidence bands: **Green 2** / **Yellow 3** / **Red 1**
- Largest decline: **Platform Observability Rollout** (Yellow, 72 ↓ -8)
- Largest improvement: **AI Modernization Engine v1** (Green, 84 ↑ +5)

## Top Emerging Risks (Decision-Oriented)
- **Data Quality Monitoring** — Red (**58 ↓ -5**) | Drivers: blocked 4d, stagnant 6d, deps 5 (critical) | Target: 9d
  - Decision prompt: *Remove blocker or re-route critical path; Escalate dependency alignment / sequence work*
  - Context: Upstream schema changes breaking checks
- **Platform Observability Rollout** — Yellow (**72 ↓ -8**) | Drivers: blocked 3d, scope changes 2/14d, stagnant 4d, deps 4 (critical) | Target: 12d
  - Decision prompt: *Freeze scope / lock acceptance criteria; Remove blocker or re-route critical path*
  - Context: API instability delaying integration testing
- **AppSec Program Revamp** — Yellow (**66 ↓ -1**) | Drivers: scope changes 3/14d | Target: 18d
  - Decision prompt: *Freeze scope / lock acceptance criteria*
  - Context: Policy review feedback loop slower than expected

## Notable Positive Momentum
- **AI Modernization Engine v1** — Green (**84 ↑ +5**) | Target: 21d
- **Jira Automation Standardization** — Yellow (**78 ↑ +4**) | Target: 14d
- **Quarterly Planning Operating Model** — Green (**88 ↑ +3**) | Target: 30d

## Decision Prompts Summary
- Scope: Where volatility is increasing, decide whether to freeze scope or re-baseline commitments.
- Dependencies: For critical path dependencies, align sequencing and escalation paths explicitly.
- Capacity: For near-term targets with declining confidence, choose: add capacity vs reduce surface area vs accept slip.
